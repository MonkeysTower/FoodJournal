# FoodJournal App

**FoodJournal** is a mobile application developed with React Native that allows you to add dishes to different categories and if necessary view already added dishes with comments left at them. That is, the application is a specialised analogue of a food notebook.


## Features
-The user can register, log in and log out of the system

-The user can take a photo of what they are eating or drinking with their phone's inbuilt camera (or add from the gallery).

-The user can then add a description of the dish to the photo.

-The user can view all the photos and descriptions they have added by clicking on the appropriate tab and swiping up and down.

-The user can view all dishes in a particular category, delete a dish card (by swiping the card to the left and selecting the appropriate button), edit/update a dish card (similarly).

### Added Features

-Sections with the addition of new dish cards with a section containing already existing dish cards separated into different tabs due to which the interface looks less loaded, switching is done by clicking on the tab of interest.
